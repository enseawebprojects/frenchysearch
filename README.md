# Frenchy Search

A frenchy search engine with the right to say NO !

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a keywords-based search engine where the user can filter the answers by clicking 
a NO button. Based on these negative answers, the engine refine a user profile in order to converge to the exact searched information

The system must provide :
* A Google-like search page with a results list
* A internal indexer (that just forward requests to Google for example)
* A filtering engine that collects negative votes
* A prediction engine that penalize the documents that resemble the downvoted ones
